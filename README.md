| Not Specified  | 9,388.01           | 1,470.06        | 9,734.08        |

‚úÖ Insight:

Express Air (most expensive) was used more evenly, even for Low or Medium priority orders.

Delivery Truck (most economical) was used heavily even for Critical orders.

üìå Recommendation:

Create a logistics policy aligning shipping method strictly with priority:

Critical = Express Air

Medium = Regular Air

Low = Delivery Truck

This ensures better budget use and delivery reliability.
